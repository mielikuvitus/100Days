# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 11, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Started (New) Responsive Web Design (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/). Did CatPhotoApp project and the Camper Cafe Menu project.

**Thoughts:** had a battle with git, which is a great way to start. If using Prettier to format, create .prettierignore file and specify it to ignore HTML to avoid weird formatting and breaking style

**Link to work:** Html and Css files for the projects have been commited under Day0 Folder
